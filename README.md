# Opal-Practice

#General Information:

FrontEnd files will be run by npm or yarn command.
Backend files will be run by python command.
Both of the folders are different in programming and run on different server we will connect them when we deploy it on the Production Server At the End of the Project.

#BACKEND
This is the Practice Full Stack Website Development Enviornment For Backend and FrontEnd Team to give head start and get themselves familiar with the project File Structure. 
I divided the project into two parts Backend Folder & Frontend Folder which is pretty self explanatory of what each part do but let's jump into it briefly.

We decided to use Django (Which is Python Framework for to write backend logic for project)

After Downloading the Zip file from Github open it in your choice of IDE Software(Pycharm, spyder, VSCODE etc...)
For Backend Developers: go to the backend folder from terminal and run: python manage.py runserver
it will open the Django landing page in your default browser. To learn more and start practicing your django skills check the django documentation and do some practive on side to get yourself familiar with it.

Follow the Documentation to Install Django in Your Computer.

https://www.djangoproject.com/download/

Note: Make sure you are in the right folder to run the django program.(All the python code is in backend folder which will handle the backend functionality of the website)


#FRONTEND

We decided to use ReactJs and Redux for FrontEnd. For Front End Developer I will ask developers to have NodeJs, npm Installed in their computer to run the project. 


So far I didn't downloaded any new library in the backend or frontend ill keep updated the docs if I do any changes.


#Optional
Install Conda to make an Environement in your Computer. https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
